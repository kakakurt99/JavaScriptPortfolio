beans are displaying the wrong colour / frame... idk why 

FIXED

Adding Npc to sell coffee beans to ...

Starting to think about crafting with coffee beans

--------------------------- 13/05/2025 --------------------------------------------------

HTML LESSON TODAY 

then

website...?

drew coffee shop npc and baskets

want to get the player to place beans in baskets and then the npc will take the beans, brew them and then make coffee and sell them. 



NEED TO FIX THIS >>>>

2. Avoid Multiple Pointerdown Listeners
You are using this.input.on('pointerdown', ...) in multiple functions (putCompostInPot, plantSeedInPot, etc.). These listeners will stack every time the scene is restarted unless they’re removed or carefully managed.

Fix:

Use a single pointerdown listener in create() that calls a handler which checks current context:

CODE NO LONGER PLACING POTS


--------------------------- 17/05/2025 ------------------------------------------

fixed global image indexes for now..

still lots of bugs.

next thing to do :
